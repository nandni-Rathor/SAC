# Hiking Recommendations Chatbot using Azure OpenAI

This project is a conversational chatbot application that provides hiking recommendations using Azure OpenAI. The chatbot takes user input, interprets it with a pre-defined system message, and generates hiking suggestions. If no specific location is provided by the user, the default location is set to Rainier National Park. The chatbot suggests three hikes of varying lengths and shares interesting facts about the local nature.
