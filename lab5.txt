The `lab5.py` script is a Python-based program that integrates Azure AI Text Analytics to perform automated text analysis. It processes text files from a designated `reviews` folder and provides valuable insights by detecting the primary language, analyzing sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), extracting key phrases, identifying named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, or dates), and linking entities to relevant URLs for context. The script leverages environment variables for secure storage of sensitive Azure credentials, which are managed through a `.env` file containing the Azure service endpoint and key. 

Before running the script, users need Python 3.8 or higher and should install the `azure-ai-textanalytics` and `dotenv` libraries. Once set up, the script processes each text file in the `reviews` folder, displaying detailed results for language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrases, entities, and linked entities. It gracefully handles errors, such as missing credentials or file path issues, ensuring a seamless user experience. Users can customize the script by changing the input folder or extending its capabilities to include additional text analysis features. This project is ideal for developers and analysts looking to automate text insights using Azure AI services.
